    <h2 class="about">A Brief History of the Hawaiian Islands</h2><br>

        <p class="about-para">1,500 years ago:  Polynesians arrive in Hawaiʻi after navigating the ocean using only the stars to guide them.
        
        1778:  Captain James Cook lands at Waimea Bay on the island of Kauaʻi, becoming the first European to make contact with the Hawaiian Islands. Cook names the archipelago the “Sandwich Islands” after the Earl of Sandwich. A year later, Cook is killed at Kealakekua Bay on the island of Hawaiʻi.
        
        1790:  The Battle of Kepaniwai was fought between forces from the island of Hawaiʻi and Maui.
        
        1795:  Battle of Nuʻuanu takes place on the southern shores of Oʻahu. It was a key battle in Kamehameha's campaign to unite the islands.
        
        1795-1874:  The Kamehameha dynasty reigns over Hawaiʻi.

<h2 class="kaua">Kauaʻi</h2>

<p class="kaua">Kauaʻi is Hawaiʻi's fourth largest island and is sometimes called the "Garden Island," which is an entirely accurate description. The oldest and northernmost island in the Hawaiian chain is draped in emerald valleys, sharp mountain spires and jagged cliffs 
aged by time and the elements. Centuries <br>of growth have formed tropical rainforests, forking rivers and cascading waterfalls! Some parts of Kauaʻi are only accessible by sea or air, 
revealing views beyond your imagination. <br>More than just dramatic beauty, 
the island is home to a variety of outdoor activities. 

<h2 class="oahu">Oʻahu</h2>

<p class="oahu">Sometimes called “The Gathering Place,” Oʻahu certainly lives up to its 
name. The third largest Hawaiian island is home to the majority of 
Hawaiʻi’s diverse population, a fusion of East and West cultures 
rooted in the values and traditions of the Native Hawaiian people.

<h2 class="lana">Lānaʻi</h2>

<p class="lana">The smallest inhabited island travelers may visit in Hawaiʻi, 
Lānaʻi offers big enticements to its visitors. Only nine miles 
from Maui yet a world away, Lānaʻi can feel like two places. 
</p><br>


<h2 class="island">Island of Hawaiʻi</h2>

<p class="island">The island of Hawaiʻi is the youngest and largest 
island in the Hawaiian chain. Nearly twice as big as 
all of the other Hawaiian Islands combined (hence, 
its nickname, “Big Island”), its sheer size is awe-inspiring. 
You can travel through all but four of the world's different 
climate zones here, ranging from Wet Tropical to Polar Tundra, 
a result of the shielding effect and elevations of the massive 
volcanoes Maunakea and Maunaloa. </p>
